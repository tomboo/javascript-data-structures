## Description
This was a project that I started to learn about JavaScript: Data Structures. However, it evolved more into an exploration of React Components and Tree controls as well as Redux and Immer for managing state in React.

## Technology Stack
- React
- Redux
- Immer

## Issues
- There is still a rendering issue with the tree control. Nodes are not always re-rendered properly when expanding or collapsing. Most likely this is related to following warning:

Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
